### Dataset

The dataset consists of open-domain dialog containing utterances that were generated from content extracted from Wikipedia articles. Multiple candidate Wikipedia passages are associated with each turn in the dialog, where one of them is considered the “reference” (i.e. correct) passage and was used to generate the response text.

### Task

The original tasks for this dataset was to (i) choose the correct passage for each turn and (ii) generate the response in the dialog using the information contained in the reference passage.

### Hints and suggestions

You could investigate one or both of the tasks described above. Moreover, you could even try to tackle the third task of retrieving the candidate set of passages for each turn in the dialog.
