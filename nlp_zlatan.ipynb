both scholars and devotees.', \"This lack of consensus is reflected in debates about the genre's history, particularly over determining its exact origins.\", 'There are two broad camps of thought, one that identifies the genre\\'s roots in early fantastical works such as the Sumerian \"Epic of Gilgamesh\" (earliest Sumerian text versions c. 2150–2000 BCE).', 'A second approach argues that science

'Science fiction films have often been used to focus on political or social issues, and to explore philosophical issues like the human condition.', 'In many cases, tropes derived from written science fiction may be used by filmmakers ignorant of or at best indifferent to the standards of scientific plausibility and plot logic to which written science fiction is traditionally held.']}, {'Alien

Lowndes took over in late 1941, and remained editor until the end.', 'The initial launch of the magazines came as part of a boom in science fiction pulp magazine publishing at the end of the 1930s.', 'In 1941 the two magazines were combined into one, titled \"Future Fiction combined with Science Fiction\", but in 1943 wartime paper shortages ended the magazine\\'s run, as Louis Silberkleit, the publisher, decided to focus his resources on his mystery and western magazine titles.']}, {'Science fiction': ['Science fiction (often shortened to SF or sci-fi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life.', 'Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \"literature of ideas\".', 'It usually avoids the supernatural, unlike the related genre of fantasy.', 'Historically, science-fiction stories have had a grounding in actual science, but now this is only expected of hard science fiction.']}, {'Galaxy Science Fiction': ['Galaxy Science Fiction was an American digest-size science fiction magazine, published from 1950 to 1980.', 'It was founded by a French-Italian company, World Editions, which was looking to break into the American market.', 'World Editions hired as editor H.
